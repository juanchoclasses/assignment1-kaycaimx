### Things that you noticed

- Did the variable names make sense? Yes, the variable names are unique and meaningful, readers can easily understand what each variable stands for. The only one minor suggestion is that since we have the variable 'rightValue' in both expression() and term() functions, maybe renaming 'value' therein to 'leftValue' would be more relatable.
- Is the code functional? Yes.
- Are the comments readable? Yes, comments are provided for all important steps which sufficiently explain the logic behind the code and are reader-friendly. Each function have docstring explaining the function's purpose.
- Are the function names self-explanatory? Yina uses several private functions to hide internal computation and delegate repeated work to these private functions (for example, expression(), term(), etc.), which is very effective and good-design of recursion. These function names are self-explanatory.
