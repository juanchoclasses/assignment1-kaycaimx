- Name: Yina Yi
- GitHub ID: yinayi
- Code review done on Sept 25, 2023

### Things that you noticed

- Did the variable names make sense? Yes.
- Is the code functional? Yes.
- Are the comments readable? Yes, comments are provided for all important steps which sufficiently explain the logic behind the code and are reader-friendly.
- Are the function names self-explanatory? Yina uses many private functions to hide internal computation and delegate repeated work to these private functions (for example, processOperator and baseCalculate), which is very effective and good-design. These function names are self-explanatory. However, some functions do not have docstring which may need to be supplemented.
